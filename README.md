# hello-world
Just my first repository

Why hello, i didn't see you there!
Welcome to the brand-new, out of the oven ReadMe file.
I'm just a guy trying to learn some coding, it seems a lot of fun and also very useful, my goal is to immerse myself into this tech world, in hope of accomplishing my dreams of becoming the better version of myself.

I'd like to learn first HTML and CSS, JS and jQ. All this while learning back-end. 
My goal is also learning about IT, Security and much more.

Enjoy!
